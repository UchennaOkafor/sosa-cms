### Omission of backend framework:
The reason I omitted the use of a backend framework such as Laravel was because this was a university project, so by using a framework,
I am not fully able to show my understanding for things frameworks like Laravel already handle e.g. (cookies, sql injection prevention, xss and csrf). 
By omitting the use of a framework, I show the marker my skills and knowledge and thus able to gain the highest potential mark.
